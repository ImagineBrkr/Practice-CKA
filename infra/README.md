You can use the Azure CLI with `az login` or you can export the following variables:
```
export ARM_CLIENT_ID="<client_id>"
export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET="<client_secret>"
export ARM_TENANT_ID="<tenant_id>"
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<subscription_id>"
```

If you are using the Azure CLI you only need to set the suscription:

```
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<subscription_id>"
```
